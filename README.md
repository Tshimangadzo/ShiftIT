# Robocode assignment

# Installation instruction

 First download the robocode setup jar, If using windows you enter the command from powershell  -> 
 java -jar <location of robocode jar>\robocode.jar e.g (java -jar H:\robocode.jar)
Then robocode have to be installed. then open java file to run it.

# Robot design

This robot started by going ahead by 100 pixels, Then scan robbot using 360 degrees looking for opponent, 
then moving back by 75 pixel and scan robot using 360 degrees rotation.

If my robbot one opponent hit my robot. My robot turn right to avoid another hit by 45 degrees and move back to make 
a space by 100 pixel.

If it does happen that robot hit the wall, it move back from the location by 20 pixel and continue searching the opponet
to hit. 

My robot have the condition to adjust the fire force according to the distance of scanned robbot, and shoot using the
distance between itself and opponent.

# My conclusion

At first i didn't know what was going on, I spent much time styding Robocode since it was my first time approching it and i have to 
understand more about its environment. Installation part was a bit hectic and i have to find a way to solve a problem. It was 
an exciting project to learn and will continue doing more practice. I had enough time to prepare myself in order to design and 
implement the system.
